      <h2>Hi, I'm Daniella ðŸ‘‹</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a dedicated Computer Science student at Oakwood University with a GPA of 3.9. I love using code to bring ideas to lifeâ€”whether that's building interactive web apps, solving real-world problems, or designing fun learning tools. I'm especially passionate about helping underrepresented communities thrive through technology.
